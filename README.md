# Union Guides

This repository contains style guides for programming languages used
in Union and some rules for contribution.

## Programming Languages

Here you can find links to style guides:

* [haskell](styles/haskell.md)
* [javascript](styles/javascript.md)

## Committing policy

We use a variation of the [OneFlow](https://www.endoflineblog.com/oneflow-a-git-branching-model-and-workflow) branching model with two branches. Naming of long-lived branches is different:
* `develop` branch from OneFlow is called `master`.
* `master` branch from OneFlow is called `production`.

To know how we commit our work see [this document](commits.md)
